# Reddot

Live DEMO: [here](https://reddot-b1116.web.app/)

## Technologies

- React
- MobX (authentication and user store)
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Hosting)

## Key functionalities that work

- Sign in with Google
- Submit post of text type
- Load posts

See the [todo.md](todo.md) file for what features are currently being built.

## What would I do differently

- use TypeScript as it is statically typed, though I resolved a chunk of debugging difficulties with PropTypes
- use Styled Components instead of JSS because of a bigger community and support
